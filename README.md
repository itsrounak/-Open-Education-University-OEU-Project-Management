# Open-Education-University-OEU-Project-Management

This is based on the Open Education University (OEU), a private university providing a variety of degree programmes to students in various countries. The company has 20 campuses in North America, Australia and Europe, with over 9,000 full time employees and another 3,500 freelance workers. Although the company is making a profit, growth at its campuses has slowed and it needs to change its strategy to continue to grow. During a recent strategic management workshop, the OEU management team decided to change its strategic goals. The following goals are more prominent:
• Expand the current customer base (of students).
• Provide an education product that is unique and can compete with the increasing supply of
qualifications.
• Improve cooperation between campuses in terms of its product offerings, sharing of resources and
knowledge, and research.
• Utilising technology for an improved product, lower costs and a subsequent competitive advantage.
